 'Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data'
 by Andrew M. Edwards, James P. W. Robinson, Michael J. Plank, Julia K. Baum
 and Julia L. Blanchard, submitted to Method in Ecology and Evolution. 

I have tried to keep required packages to a minimum, but you will need:
  plotrix  (only for histograms with gaps, as for Figure 1)
  dplyr
  (and their dependencies).

The resulting figures (as .eps postscript files) are also included so that
 code can be independnetly re-run and the results easily compared with my 
 original figures. I have included the .RData file for the results for 
 the main simulation of 10,000 data sets (multiple/fitting3rep.r) 
 and for the xmax=10000 simulation (multiple/xmax10000/fitting3rep10000.r)
 because the code can take a while to run and the two resulting .RData files
 are used to produce Figure 3. The remainaing .RData files are have
 not been included because they are generally large.

The main figures in the manuscript can be found in the following directories:

Figures 1 and 2 - code/single/
Figures 3 and 4 - code/multiple/
Figure 5 - code/MLEbin/
Figure 6 - code/recommend/

So to use the MLE method to analyse your own data and plot results as per
 our Figure 6, see code/recommend/ . If your data are binned then you will
 need some of code/MLEbin/ .

Tidy these up once have done the re-run bracnch - see readRerun.txt.

** Code was mainly developed under R version 3.1.0, although I then upgraded to
 version 3.2.3 in January 2016. I have re-run the code in the latest version
 of R and get the same results, though it seems that minor (insignficant)
 changes may occur. For example, re-running  multiple/fitting3rep.r 
 under version 3.2.3 gives 59% as the last number in the LCD row of Table 2,
 but the original simulations (version 3.1.0, and also a test with version
 3.2.2 on another computer) gives 60% - likely due to the random
 number generation. Though the difference is only due to 4 out of the 10,000
 simulations changing the estimate of b in the fifth signficant figure, and
 so not important in practice.
** Aha - it's to do with the issue I had last year  - see seedTest/ and decide
 what to do. But not relevant in practice. Random numbers in saved fitting3rep.RData are shifted compared to re-running now. Seems to be opposite to what I'd
 said in seedTest/.

** GOING THROUGH EACH piece of code listed below, in turn, and rerunning 
 using command line (not replacing figures or saving .RData) to check get
 same, or close enough, answer. **Now creating separate git branch re-run,
 re-running and checking results with original: ssmRevBeforeRerun.pdf. 

**PROB DELETE: Some code then broke (due to indexing) and is now fixed, but
 I may not have re-run all code from scratch under 3.2.3. If you encounter 
 problems then please contact me. **Am re-running all code under 3.2.3.

I have functionalised code where practical, though I did not go back everywhere
 and replace original non-function code with functions; further improvements 
 are no doubt possible. 

The full list of directories and code is now given.

readMeCode.txt - this file

PLBfunctions.r - collection of documented functions called by the other 
 R code.

code/single/ - simulate a single data set and fit spectra using the eight methods
************

fitting2.r - simulates a data set and then fits spectra using eight methods,
 producing Figures 1, 2 and A.1.


code/multiple/ - simulate 10,000 data sets and fit using the eight methods
**************

fitting3rep.r - results from 10,000 simulated data sets, to give the blue
 histograms in Figure 3 and the main results in Table 2. Also does the
 MLEfix method and plots Figure A.3.

fitting3rep.RData - results from fitting3rep.r, to save having to re-run it.

fitting3repAdd.r - constructing Figure 3, combining simulation results from
 two sets of 10,000 simulated data sets (fitting3rep.r and 
 xmax10000/fitting3rep10000.r).

fitting3conf.r - Figure 4 plots of confidence intervals, and Figure A.4 for
 MLEfix method.

fitting3bmaxx.r - Figure A.2, showing relationship between MLE of b and MLE 
 of x_max for the 10,000 simulated data sets from Figure 3. And Figure A.5 for
 MLEfix method.

The following are the sensitivity analyses. Some are just modifications 
 of the above code, with new a value of a parameter (e.g. xmax)
 and renaming of anything that is saved (.RData and .eps files), and 
 changing of axes sizes where necessary (and maybe some other necessary tweaks).
 The above code may have been updated (written more clearly) after some of
 the following were done.

code/multiple/xmax10000/  - simulate 10,000 datasets with xmax = 10,000
************************

fitting2-10000new.r - as for fitting2.r but for xmax=10,000, to produce 
 Figures A.6 and A.7.

fitting3rep10000.r - as for fitting3rep.r but for xmax=10,000, to give
 gold histograms in Figure 3 and results in Table A.1.

fitting3rep10000.RData - results from fitting3rep10000.r, which gets
 called in multiple/fitting3repAdd.r to produce Figure 3. 

fitting3conf10000.r - as for fitting3conf.r but for xmax=10,000, to give
 Figure A.8.

fitting3bmaxx10000.r - Figure A.9 for the MLE and MLEfix methods, with 
 xmax = 10,000.

 Section A.2.8 in the Appendix.

 binning the data and then applying likelihood.

fitting3repMLEbin.Rdata - results from fitting3repMLEbin.r, since this file is 
 small.

fitting3confMLEbin.r  - confidence intervals for MLEbin method, to give Figure 5.


code/recommend/
***************

recommend.r - Figure 6, recommended MLE calculations and resulting plots of 
 data and fitted size spectrum.

--

To test sensitivity of results to xmax, b etc. (as I've done above), create a
 new folder, and then copy in, rename and edit the files fitting2.r, 
 fitting3rep.r and fitting3conf.r (or ones above that are closer to what
 you are testing - e.g. use b=-2.5 if testing b=-2.6). 

Such edits include: change required parameter value, change .eps and .RData
 filenames, and then may need to manually edit axes since it's hard to
 fully automate them, particularly the barplot with a gap, as in the 
 function  gap.barplot.cust.

To re-run code with a different seed, say 43, just change set.seed(42)
 to set.seed(43) and make sure redo.simulation=TRUE (if it's there) so
 that it doesn't just load in an already saved .RData file. It's best to first
 move the code to a new directory.


Most files have a  
   redo.simulation = TRUE   
or
   redo.simulation = FALSE
option at the start, and they will be mostly set to FALSE to just load in
the simulation results, because I would have been tweaking the figures for
publication. So obviously set to TRUE for the first run, until you have an
.RData file that can then be loaded in.
