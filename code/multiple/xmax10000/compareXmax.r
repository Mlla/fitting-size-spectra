# compareXmax.r - comparing sample of 1,000 random PLB numbers
#  for xmax=1,000 and xmax=10,000 with same seed, to demonstrate
#  that have to be careful because the resulting samples are quite
#  similar (due to inverse method, and hardly any chance of being
#  >1,000 with xmax=10,000). As documented in Section A.2.8 in
#  the Appendix.
