This repository contains R code for the paper 

**Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data** 

by Andrew M. Edwards, James P. W. Robinson, Michael J. Plank, Julia K. Baum and Julia L. Blanchard

that has been accepted for publication in ***Methods in Ecology and Evolution***. 

Email me if you would like a copy of the paper, and please cite it if you end up using the code.

The aim of sharing this code is so that others can repeat (and extend) our simulation study, and also analyse their own data.

To download the code from the GitHub site just click the 'Clone or Download' button (near the top on the right) and select 'Download ZIP'. If you use GitHub then feel free to fork and even adapt the code.

To *exactly* reproduce the results in the paper
download release version 1.0.0 (click on 'release' tab in the GitHub site) and see the notes in **code/readReRun.txt**. Later updates of the code will have some generalisation in functions that should not affect the older code (but I won't re-test it all for back compatibility). 

If you want to run new simulations or apply the code to your own data then just use the latest version that will be automatically displayed on the GitHub site (make a note of the date that you download it, in case you have any questions for me).

There are functions (in **code/PLBfunctions.r**) that may be of more general use, such as **logTicks()** for adding tick marks to a log-log plot, and **legJust()** for right-justifying a legend (based on an example in **?legend**). 

If you have problems with the code then please contact me. Some of it has been independently used by co-author James Robinson, who got it working fine for his own data.

Thanks,

Andrew Edwards.
