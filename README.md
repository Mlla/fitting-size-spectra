Methods for fitting size spectra to data

Here is the R code for our manuscript 

"Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data"

that we are currently revising for *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. I will update this site if the manuscript gets accepted. Meanwhile I am migrating my code for the manuscript from a private GitHub repository to this public one, and improving the information so that others can use the code to analyse their own data.
