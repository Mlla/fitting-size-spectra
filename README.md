# fitting-size-spectra

This repository contains R code for the manuscript 

**Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data** 

Andrew M. Edwards, James P. W. Robinson, Michael J. Plank, Julia K. Baum and Julia L. Blanchard

that we submitted and are currently revising for *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. 

I will update this information if the manuscript gets accepted. Meanwhile I am migrating my code for the manuscript from a private GitHub repository to this public one, so that I can improve the code and then just zip it up to submit to the journal. I am also improving the documentation so so that others can use the code to analyse their own data and repeat our study.

To download the code from the GitHub site just click the 'Download zip', which will zip up all the files. If you use GitHub then feel free to fork and even adapt the code. Until I've finalised the revisions the code may keep improving, but it should all work.  

This README.md file is in Markdown; if you download it and do not have a Markdown viewer (I use MarkdownPad 2) then you can just open it in any text editor. But the code/ directory will have a READcode.txt file.

# Contents

**README.md** - this file

**.gitignore** - don't worry if you don't know what this is
